# My-NoteBook

Our Notes web app is a MERN stack project that allows users to create, edit, and organize their notes in a simple and intuitive interface. The app features user authentication and authorization, with secure password storage using bcrypt and token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

The back-end of the app is built with Node.js and Express, and uses MongoDB for data storage. The API is designed to be RESTful, with routes for creating, updating, and deleting notes. The app uses Mongoose for object modeling, and includes robust error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.
